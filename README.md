# Schizophrenia-Disorder-Identification-using-CNN-based-on-EEG-data


The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for the detection of schizophrenia . 

The project has a number of distinct objectives. First, we will use used high-quality EEG dataset containing EEG data of both healthy controls and patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. To guarantee data quality, preprocessing methods like noise reduction and artifact removal will be used . Second, specific features will be taken out of the EEG signals and fed into the CNN model. This is an important step in identifying the abnormalities and patterns that point to schizophrenia .
Another crucial goal is creating the CNN architecture. To efficiently train and categorize EEG signal patterns, the model will be designed with the proper layers, activation functions, and optimization strategies. In order to train the model, appropriate datasets must be chosen, strict validation procedures must be followed, and performance must be assessed using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity .
Putting the CNN model to use and testing it in actual clinical settings is the ultimate objective. By doing this, the group hopes to give doctors a useful tool that will help with the correct and timely diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, this project's results can further advances in neuroscience and psychiatric research by providing fresh perspectives on the neurological foundations of schizophrenia.

In conclusion, the goal of this study is to better diagnose schizophrenia by utilizing CNNs and EEG signals. This will improve patient treatment and broaden the scope of mental health diagnoses.
